Key Features:

1. Post updates with titles and content.
2. View posts from other users in a dynamic and real-time feed.
3. Seamless integration of WebSockets for instant updates.
4. Simple and intuitive API endpoints for easy interaction.
5. FeedMe is designed for simplicity and real-time communication, making it perfect for building social platforms, news feeds, or collaborative applications.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Create `.env` file in root directory and add your MongoDB URI, JWT Secret Key.

## Usage

### Starting the API Server

To start the RESTful API server, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your Node.js project where the `app.js` or main server file is located:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/node/project
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the server: `npm start`

4. The server will be accessible at http://localhost:your-port in your web browser or through API client tools. Replace your-port with the port number you've configured in your project (e.g., 3000).

5. You can now use API client tools (e.g., Postman, curl) or make HTTP requests from your applications to interact with the API Endpoints.

Example: To create a new post, you can make a POST request to http://localhost:your-port/feed/post (replace your-port with the actual port number).
